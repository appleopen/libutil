.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn reexec_to_match_kernel
function re-executes the current binary to match the ABI of the running kernel.
That is, if the current kernel is a 64-bit Intel kernel, it will attempt to
execute the 64-bit x86_64 userspace slice of the universal binary. The API
intentionally does not take arguments because its use should be transparent
to the program and to the user.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn reexec_to_match_kernel
function returns 0 if re-execution was not required. It returns -1 and
sets errno if there was an error performing the re-execution, for example
if the binary is not universal, or does not contain a slice to match the running
kernel's ABI. If the function succeeds, control never returns to the caller
and the program starts from main() again.
